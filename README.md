# MacPhotosMount

## Purpose

This repository provides a python script to mount a .photoslibrary file generated by Mac OS X Photos as a readonly external filesystem. Albums will be mounted as folders in the correct path, and photos will appear on each album. The library file is never edited, so there is no danger of data lost.

## Usage

To mount a library called mylibrary.photoslibrary on an empty directory called mountpoint:

```
python3 main.py mylibrary.photoslibrary mountpoint/
```

The code has been written and tested with Ubuntu 20.04.

## Why mounting the library instead of just copying the files?

Mounting is a cheap operation that allows the user to decide which fotos do they want before commiting to a (possibly expensive) copy. Since the mounted filesystem acts only as an interface, no data will be copied unless the user copies it explicitely.
