# MacPhotosMount

## Purpose

This repository provides a python script to mount a .photoslibrary file generated by Mac OS X Photos as a readonly external filesystem. Albums will be mounted as folders in the correct path, and photos will appear on each album.

## Usage

To mount a library called mylibrary.photoslibrary on an empty directory called mountpoint:

```
python3 main.py mylibrary.photoslibrary mountpoint/
```

## Why mounting the library instead of just copying the files?

Mounting is a cheap operation that allows the user to decide which fotos do they want before commiting to a (possibly expensive) copy. Since the mounted filesystem acts only as an interface, no data will be copied unless the user copies it explicitely.
